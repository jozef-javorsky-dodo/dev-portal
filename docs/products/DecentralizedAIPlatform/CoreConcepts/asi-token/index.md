# ASI Token

SingularityNET uses the ASI Token for its marketplace. The ASI Token is an ERC-20 token hosted on the Ethereum Blockchain. Right now, we are in the `beta` phase of the SingularityNET Marketplace. That means that you will need to use Sepolia Testnet ASI to work with our tools.

## Testnet ASI vs Mainnet ASI
For those new to Ethereum, it may be a bit confusing what exactly the difference between Testnet and Mainnet tokens are. In principle, you can distinguish them as follows:
* Testnet tokens are used to test software applications with, try out demos, or in our case the Beta.
* Mainnet tokens are used for officially deployed software.
* Testnet tokens never have a monetary value.
* Mainnet tokens could have a monetary value.
* Both tokens can be used to add extra utility to the software.

For testnet we use [Sepolia Testnet ASI](https://faucet.singularitynet.io/). You can find our Mainnet ASI Token (to be used in a later stage) [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5B7533812759B45C2B44C19e320ba2cD2681b542) with the address `0x5B7533812759B45C2B44C19e320ba2cD2681b542`.

<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong> While we are aware that the ASI token is currently being traded on some exchanges, we do not encourage or facilitate this exchange trading in any manner. Speculative secondary trading is against the spirit of the ASI token and SingularityNET project. We strongly discourage speculative secondary trading and officially ask ASI token holders to act accordingly.</p>
