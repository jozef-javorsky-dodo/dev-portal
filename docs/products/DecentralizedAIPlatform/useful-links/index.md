#### **AI Marketplaces**

**ASI (FET)**

1. [**AI Marketplace Mainnet**](https://marketplace.singularitynet.io/)
   The main platform for publishing and accessing live AI services using the **ASI (FET)** token.

2. [**AI Marketplace Testnet**](https://testnet.marketplace.singularitynet.io/)
   A Sepolia-based testing environment for services using **ASI (FET)**.
   Only visible to the service publisher.

**AGIX (❗Deprecated❗)**

1. [**Legacy Marketplace Mainnet**](https://agix-marketplace.singularitynet.io/)
2. [**Legacy Marketplace Testnet**](https://testnet.agix-marketplace.singularitynet.io/)

> ⚠️ **Deprecated:** These Marketplaces contain services published with the AGIX token.
> Once a service is updated and re-published, it will automatically migrate to **ASI (FET)** and be removed from the AGIX Marketplace.
> We recommend migrating all services to ASI (FET) as soon as possible.

_How it works:_ In the **Publisher Portal**, users create organizations and publish services that can then be accessed and utilized on the AI Marketplaces.

#### **Publisher Portal**

1. [Publisher Portal Mainnet](https://publisher.singularitynet.io/)  
   The main Publisher portal for deploying and configuring AI services to the Mainnet.

2. [Publisher Portal Testnet](https://testnet.publisher.singularitynet.io/)  
   A private Publisher portal for publishing and configuring AI services in the User Test environment.

#### **UI Sandbox**

[AI UI Constructor](https://ai-ui-constructor.singularitynet.io/)  
**UI Sandbox** is a powerful and versatile development environment that provides tools for:

-   Creating custom modules and services.
-   Online compilation for instant testing.
-   Fast file upload and export for streamlined workflows.
-   Library of components for accelerated interface development.

The environment supports flexible customization, allowing users to write and compile code, create and reuse modules, and share them with other developers. This makes the development process efficient, collaborative, and adaptable to various use cases.

#### **Faucets**

1. [ASI (FET) Faucet (Sepolia Network)](https://faucet.singularitynet.io/)  
   Allows users to receive test ASI (FET) tokens for use in the Testnet. This ensures that testing and publishing services occur without the need for real tokens.

2. [ETH Faucet (Sepolia Network)](https://www.infura.io/zh/faucet/sepolia)  
   Provides test ETH for paying transaction fees on the Sepolia Testnet.
