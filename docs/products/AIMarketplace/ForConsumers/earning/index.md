# Earnings
Once your service has been published on the Marketplace its available for all to use. You will start earning ASI (FET) 
tokens as people interact and purchase your service. The ASI (FET) tokens thus earned are captured in the payment channel 
set up between the user of the service and the **Payment Address** that has been configured in the 
[organization](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/OnboardingViaCLI/#organization-setup). The 
[payment channel storage](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/Daemon/daemon-channel-storage/)
section has in depth explantion of how this works.

## Claiming ASI (FET) Tokens
* ASI (FET) tokens earned are availabe in the channel created between the user and the Payment address configured in the 
Organization
* Only the user who operates the Payment address can claim tokens
* Tokens can be claimed by using the snet-cli or the publisher portal
