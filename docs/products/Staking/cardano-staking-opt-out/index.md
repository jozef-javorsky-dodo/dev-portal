# Stake Opt-out

When a user stakes **ASI (FET) Tokens**, they have the option to **opt out** of the next staking window.  
By default, the staked amount along with the earned reward is automatically carried over into the next staking period.

## Opt-out options

There are two points at which a user can choose to opt out:

1. **At the time of staking**  
   Users can specify during the staking process that they do not wish to participate in the next staking window.

2. **Near the end of the current staking period**  
   A dedicated opt-out window is provided before the staking period ends, allowing users to change their original decision if needed.

## Effect of opting out

Opting out ensures that the current staked amount and rewards are **not carried over** into the next staking window.  
This gives the user the ability to **withdraw** their tokens once the current staking period ends.

## Access via ASI (FET) Staking DApp

All opt-out related actions can be performed through the [**ASI (FET) Staking DApp**](https://staking.singularitynet.io/), which provides a clear and straightforward interface for managing staking preferences.
